                                       The purpose of these comparisons is to determine how consistent the detection of MHWs may be between these
                                       different products. Because these products are all based on infrared SST detection any large differences 
                                       in the results should be based on the different data assimilation methods used by these different organisations.
                                       It was revealed through these comparisons that the most important such difference was the handling of ocean pixels 
                                       that experienced any ice cover throughout the year. It appears that there are fundamental differences in the 
                                       ice cover algorithms used between these products and any MHW results ~60Â°N/S or further poleward are not
